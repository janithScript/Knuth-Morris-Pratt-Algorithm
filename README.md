# Knuth-Morris-Pratt Algorithm

To design and implement a string matching operation by using the Knuth-Morris-Pratt (KMP)
algorithm which is an effective way of finding patterns from the paragraph. String matching operation
is a core part of many text processing applications, e.g., the design of compilers and text
editors. Thus, locating patterns in a text efficiently is very important and is a crucial task.
